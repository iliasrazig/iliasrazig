# 👋 Hi, I'm Ilias Razig  

**Data Scientist | AI Engineer**  

I build intelligent systems at the intersection of **statistics, machine learning, and real-world impact**.  
From LLM-powered automation systems to deep learning vision models, I try to design solutions that turn complex data into operational leverage.
